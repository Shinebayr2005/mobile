            <p class="title">Gatotkaca Story</p>
            <p class="storymain">Gatotkaca "The Man of Steel" was the son of Bima and Arimbi from the Arcapada universe. Since his childhood, Gatotkaca has been a champion of Gods, fighting vicious enemies in his homeland. Once lost and beaten near death, Gatotkaca rose as a mighty warrior from the Pandava clan who possessed supernatural powers, which he had recieved from the ultimate training inside the cauldron of heaven, Candradimuka. With his Antakusuma armor and Brajamusti-Brajadenta twin gauntlet, he can sore across the skies like lightning and hunt down his enemies, the furious Ashuras, and their king, Martis Martis. Gatotkaca, the Knight of Priggadani, has ever since been a symbol of bravery and devotion.</p>
