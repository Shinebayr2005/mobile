            <p class="title">Angela Story</p>
            <p class="storymain">An android created by the founder of Laboratory 1718, Dr. Baker. It was the first life form created without using human body or soul. In order to gain the knowledge of her, other scientists in the lab went after Dr. Baker. Before taken away, Dr. Baker stuffed her into a flight capsule to escape.Lore
                Dr. Baker was one of the co-founders of Laboratory 1718, an institution created with the aim of bringing peace to the world. But as his colleagues, that is, the other scientists fell deeper and deeper into their depraved human weaponization experiments, Dr. Baker felt he had no choice but to leave all this behind and pursue a new project. Renouncing the questionable ethics of human experimentation, he endeavored to create a new kind of lifeform, solely from a mechanical skeleton, puppet strings, and synthetic skin. Finally, a new generation of artificial life was born. Dr. Baker firmly believed that, love and hope were the greatest inventions of mankind. So[,] he programmed the world's most moving stories into the heart of his new creation, transforming her into an android[-]based robot, meant for helping others.
                One bright morning, Peace Android Prototype 1 awakened from her bed, and Dr. Baker bestowed upon this adorable mechanical angel, the Name Angela. Angela followed Dr. Baker's tutelage, studying hard to understand the world, and hoping to meet the inventor's high expectations. However, their peaceful life together, was soon cut short. When the mad scientist of Lab 1718, heard rumors that Dr. Baker had created a living soul outside a human body, which didn't meet their ideas of creating flesh weapons, they couldn't bear to believe it. They were convinced among themselves that Baker had betrayed them, keeping this knowledge to himself before fleeing, and so they ordered Dr. Baker's past creations, Alpha and Beta Alpha and Beta to hunt down Dr. Baker and his creation. As their pursuers were just about to close in on them, Dr. Baker placed Angela into a flight capsule, instructing her to seek out his good friend Rooney.
