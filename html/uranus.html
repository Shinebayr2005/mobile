            <p class="storymain">The Celestial Palace - Legend has it that the city floating above the skies of the Land of Dawn was once home to the Gods. It is also rumored that this mysterious place holds the key to ruling the world. Eons ago, the ruler of the Celestial Palace utilized the technological secret of the ancients to create Uranus, then commanded it to guard the city and await the emergence of a new ruler. When the scholars of the Land of Dawn found and opened the gates to the Celestial Palace, the battle between the Dawn Zenith and the Dark Abyss quickly spread throughout the realm, disrupting the solitude of the ancient city. The two forces sought to occupy the Celestial Palace as a symbol of victory, their heroes unleashing the full extent of their power and finally reaching an impasse. The massive influx of energy generated throughout the incessant battles eventually awakened the city's defense system, converting the released energy into pure lightning, fed into Uranus and reawakened after dormancy within the depths of the Celestial Palace. "Leave now, intruders!" he roared upon awakening, charging into the battlefield fueled by lightning, aether and ready to fulfill his destiny. His goalâ€”to purge these savage intruders that had disturbed the tranquility of the Celestial Palace.</p>
