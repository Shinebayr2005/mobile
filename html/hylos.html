            <p class="storymain">Amidst the misty mountains within the northern reaches of the Land of Dawn, resides the ancient and mysterious race of Centaurs, half-man, half-horse creatures. The Centaurs guard a fountain that rests among the highest mountain peak. This fountain is said to give the gift of Immortality and Infinite wisdom. Dark forces have relentlessly tried to gain the power found within the waters of this fountain, but only to be time and time again be thwarted by the centaurs. However, as time went on, the centaurs became tired and attrition soon took hold. It was not until Hylos had arrived, where he threw his mastery of nature's wrath, he was able to crush and punish all the invaders of the fountain. He had become a legendary figure within the annals of the Land of Dawn.</p>
